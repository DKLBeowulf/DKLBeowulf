- 👋 Hi, I’m @DKLBeowulf
- 👀 I’m interested in
        learning how to code and program.  I am currently learning powershell and python and have already found out how rewarding this all can be.
        When I was a kid in the 90s I used to mess up hand me down computers by corrupting files.  I can finally get past that dead end with programming since I won't be 
        destroying or altering anything important...so far.
            I also like to build vintage scooters and I have a nice 1979 Vespa P series that I built from parts a friend sold to me.  Other than that I am pretty laid back and the 
            usual interest me like games and tech.  I have a passion for old MUDS and roguelike games.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning 
         Python and Powershell with the hope that I can get some sort of entry level job within the next year that pays far better.  I have been doing retail
        and service jobs for the most of my life and it is a soul sucking experience.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on 
      code reviews and I would like to connect with other people that also are learning python and hopefully someone to help mentor me on my journey.

      is my email at whoover86@gmail.com
